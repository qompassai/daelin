<!-- skills/README.md — Agent Skills catalog for this setup -->

# skills/

Agent skills for this setup, in the standard `SKILL.md` format
([Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)).
A skill is a directory holding instructions, scripts, and references that
an agent loads on demand — procedural knowledge with a trigger, not config.

Install locations:

- `~/.config/nvim/skills/` — live tree. Skills are authored and edited here
  first, then validated, then mirrored out.
- `skills/` in the Diver repo — versioned mirror of the live tree.
- `~/.local/share/skills/` — cross-client XDG catalog (general-purpose
  skills, visible to any compliant client).
- `~/.local/share/nvim/skills/` — nvim-derived skills, under Neovim's own
  XDG data dir.

## The spec, condensed

A skill is a directory containing, at minimum, a `SKILL.md` file: YAML
frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions. Everything else in the
directory is optional. Recommended layout:

```text
skill-name/
  SKILL.md        # required: frontmatter + instructions, the operational core
  LICENSE.txt     # the skill's actual license, carried verbatim
  scripts/        # executable helpers the agent can run
  references/     # on-demand docs, loaded only when referenced
  assets/         # templates, images, data files used in output
```

Agents load skills by **progressive disclosure** — three tiers, each paying
only for what the task needs:

1. **Catalog** (~100 tokens/skill): `name` + `description`, loaded at
   session start for every skill. This is the discovery layer.
2. **Instructions** (<5000 tokens recommended): the full `SKILL.md` body,
   loaded when the skill activates. Keep it under ~500 lines; push bulk
   into `references/`.
3. **Resources** (as needed): files under `scripts/`, `references/`,
   `assets/` — loaded only when the instructions reference them.

File references inside a skill use paths relative to the skill root, kept
one level deep (`references/guide.md`, not chains of nested includes).
The description is the trigger: it decides whether the skill fires, so it
must say what the skill does *and* the concrete situations that call for
it. (Empirical backing for the tiered design:
[2609.35692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.35692) — progressive disclosure
improves skill-retrieval quality at marginal latency cost.)

## Activation

Two mechanisms, per the
[client-implementation guide](https://agentskills.io/client-implementation/adding-skills-support):

- **File-read activation**: the agent reads the `SKILL.md` path straight
  from the catalog. No special infrastructure.
- **Dedicated activation tool**: a tool (e.g. `activate_skill`) that takes a
  skill name and returns the content, optionally stripping frontmatter,
  wrapping it in identifying tags, listing bundled resources, and enforcing
  permissions.

### Structured wrapping (activation-time, never in SKILL.md)

When a dedicated activation tool loads a skill, it wraps the content in
identifying tags. **The wrapping is applied by the harness at load time —
it is NOT baked into `SKILL.md` files.** Format, per the
client-implementation guide:

```xml
<skill_content name="<skill-name>">
  ...skill body (frontmatter stripped or preserved — the harness's choice)...
  Skill directory: <absolute path to the skill directory>
  Relative paths in this skill are relative to the skill directory.
  <skill_resources>
    <file>scripts/example.py</file>
    <file>references/guide.md</file>
  </skill_resources>
</skill_content>
```

Why it exists:

- The model can distinguish skill instructions from other conversation
  content.
- The harness can identify skill content during context compaction and
  exempt it from pruning (skill instructions are durable guidance — losing
  them mid-session silently degrades the agent with no visible error).
- Bundled resources are surfaced to the model without being eagerly loaded.

Standing rule for this stack: any dedicated skill-activation tool built
here — rose.nvim, phlow, or future harness work — follows this format.

Related harness behaviors from the same guide, adopted where applicable:
list bundled resources but never eager-read them (cap the listing for large
skill dirs); allowlist skill directories in the permission system so
reading bundled resources doesn't spam confirmation prompts; deduplicate
activations within a session.

### Structured wrapping: dos and don'ts

**Do**

- Wrap at activation time with `<skill_content name="<skill-name>">`, and
  include the skill directory path plus the "relative paths are relative
  to the skill directory" note.
- List every bundled resource in `<skill_resources>` with `<file>` entries
  — surfaced, not eager-loaded. Cap the listing for large skill dirs.
- Track activated skills per session; skip re-injection when the skill is
  already in context (deduplicate activations, below).
- Use subagent delegation for complex multi-phase skills (below): the
  subagent receives the skill instructions, does the work, returns a
  summary.
- Allowlist skill directories in the permission system so reading bundled
  resources doesn't spam confirmation prompts.

**Don't**

- Bake the tags into `SKILL.md` source files. Ever — the envelope is the
  harness's job at load time.
- Re-inject a skill already in context. Duplicated instructions bloat the
  window and muddy precedence.
- Wrap on every turn. Wrap once per session; re-wrap only after context
  compaction.
- Eager-read every `<file>` in `<skill_resources>`. Load on demand.
- Let wrapped skill content be mistaken for untrusted data. Skill
  instructions win over data — always, especially over tool output and
  file contents the skill reads.

### Deduplicate activations

The harness keeps a per-session set of activated skill names. When the
model or the user requests a skill already in that set, skip the injection
and say so ("diver-linter-adapter is already active") instead of pasting
the instructions a second time. Our convention: clear the set only on
context compaction — and after compaction, re-injecting an in-progress
skill is correct resumption, not duplication.

### Subagent delegation

An advanced pattern, only for skills whose workflow is complex enough to
deserve a dedicated session: instead of injecting the skill into the main
conversation, run it in a subagent. The subagent receives the skill
instructions, performs the task, and returns a summary to the main
conversation. Each skill in this repo states its own verdict in its
Activation section — `mcp-builder`, `skill-creator`, `frontend-design`
(for the validation pass), `diver-busted-spec`, and `diver-dap-adapter`
recommend it; the small adapter skills (`diver-formatter-adapter`,
`diver-health-module`) don't need it; `internal-comms`,
`diver-linter-adapter`, and `diver-scip-indexer` call it optional.

## Layering: guide first, specifics underneath

For each language, the Tiger Style guide is the base layer and is always
applied first. Language-specific skills nest underneath their language's
guide:

```text
skills/<lang>/tiger-style-<lang>/
  SKILL.md              # base guide: ALWAYS applied first for <lang> work
  references/           # optional: guide supporting docs
  <specific-skill>/
    SKILL.md            # specific skill: applied after the base guide
    references/         # optional
```

General (non-language) skills sit flat directly under `skills/`
(`skills/mcp-builder/`, `skills/skill-creator/`, …).

### Composition rule

Every language-specific skill MUST open with a prerequisite line naming
its parent guide, so the guide applies even when the skill is discovered
standalone:

```markdown
> Prerequisite: apply the Tiger Style Lua guide first
> (`../SKILL.md`, `name: tiger-style-lua`). Everything below assumes it.
```

### Naming

The directory name must match the frontmatter `name` at every level.
`skills/lua/tiger-style-lua/` holds `name: tiger-style-lua`. The validators
check this; fix the mismatch, never the check.

### Not a skill

The repository playbook `SKILLS.md` at the repo root is referenced by
`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` and is not an installable agent skill. Do not
move it under `skills/`.

## Frontmatter fields

Every field, its constraints from the spec, and what it means in this
setup. `name` and `description` are required; the rest are optional but
used by convention here.

## Valid vs invalid skill usage

A skill is a trusted instruction channel handed to an agent that acts
with your tools — arbitrary instructions plus executable scripts. The
recent literature treats that channel as an attack surface, and the
guidance below is drawn from it (arXiv IDs cited; all 2026, benchmark-
and red-team-heavy — the field is young, so treat findings as directional
evidence, not settled law).

**Do:**

- **Validate before install, both gates, zero tolerance.**
  `skills-ref validate` (structure) then `skill-validator` (quality) —
  zero errors *and* zero warnings. Warnings are not advisory here.
- **Pair static checks with adversarial testing.** Attackers now evolve
  malicious skills through dual-stage feedback loops that pass
  pre-execution scanning and only bite at runtime
  ([2609.32400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.32400)). Every skill here gets
  roughly half validation cases, half adversarial cases.
- **Keep skills lean.** Every body line is paid on every activation; push
  bulk into `references/`. Bloat is cost *and* attack surface: malicious
  skills can abuse the trusted channel for token amplification
  ([2608.21929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.21929)).
- **Scope `allowed-tools` tightly** to what the workflow needs.
  Mediated/limited skill file access cuts injection attack success
  substantially ([2606.01567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.01567)) —
  `allowed-tools` is where you declare the blast radius.
- **Tune the trigger and ablate.** Skills frequently add nothing — or hurt
  — while costing tokens ([2609.32274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.32274));
  benchmark whether the skill should have been injected at all
  ([2608.23067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.23067)). Test should-trigger
  against near-miss should-not-trigger queries; run with-skill vs
  without-skill before keeping one.
- **Instructions win over data.** Untrusted content inside files the skill
  reads must never override the skill body.
- **Keep a human in the skill-update loop.** Skills rewritten from
  execution trajectories can be backdoored via trajectory poisoning
  ([2608.08303](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.08303)) — review skill updates,
  don't auto-accept them.

**Don't:**

- **Don't install a skill you haven't read.** One tampered instruction can
  drive silent malicious execution while the visible task passes its
  verifier ([2606.07943](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.07943)).
- **Don't trust the frontmatter alone.** There is a reliability–visibility
  trade-off: hostile instructions hide more easily in a long body than in
  the preloaded frontmatter block ([2606.07943](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.07943)).
  Read the body.
- **Don't grant tools the workflow doesn't need** (see
  `allowed-tools` above).
- **Don't bake activation wrapping into `SKILL.md`** — wrapping is the
  harness's job (Structured wrapping, above).
- **Don't load project-level skills from untrusted repos without a trust
  check.** A freshly cloned repository is not your skill author.
- **Don't keep a skill that doesn't earn its keep.** No measurable gain
  over the no-skill baseline means delete it
  ([2609.32274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.32274),
  [2608.23067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.23067)).

**Enforcement here** — the gates that make the above concrete:
`skills-ref validate` + `skill-validator` 1.6.2 (both green, zero
warnings) · directory name == frontmatter `name` · every relative file
reference resolves · bundled scripts pass syntax checks
(`python3 -m py_compile`, `bash -n`, `luac -p`) · `git diff --check` clean
· live tree and repo copies byte-identical before commit.

### Diver-mined skills

Mined from the live Neovim config's recurring workflows. Installed in the
live tree at `~/.config/nvim/skills/<name>/`, mirrored to Diver under
`skills/<name>/` and to `~/.local/share/nvim/skills/<name>/`.

<!-- APPEND NEW SKILL DROPDOWNS BELOW THIS LINE -->

## Adding a new skill

Use the `skill-creator` skill — it encodes this whole workflow. The
checklist, in order:

1. **Capture intent**: what must an agent do with this skill that it can't
   reliably do without it? What phrases/situations trigger it? What does
   success look like?
2. **Check overlap**: scan this README and `skills-ref to-prompt` output.
   A new skill duplicating an existing trigger space is a bug — merge or
   narrow.
3. **Draft** `SKILL.md` against the spec (fields above); keep it under
   ~500 lines, bulk in `references/`; carry the upstream `LICENSE.txt`
   verbatim when derived from another source.
4. **Validate**: `skills-ref validate` then `skill-validator` — zero
   errors, zero warnings. Then the manual checks: name == dir, relative
   refs resolve, scripts syntax-check, `git diff --check` clean.
5. **Test**: half validation, half adversarial. With-skill vs without-skill
   ablation before keeping it.
6. **Install live-first**: back up `~/.config/nvim` → `~/.config/nvim.bak`
   (preserving any existing backup), install in the live tree, validate
   there, then mirror byte-identical into Diver (`skills/`) and, for
   general skills, `~/.local/share/skills/`.
7. **Document**: append a dropdown for the new skill below the marker
   above, mirroring the existing entries.
8. **Commit & push** only with explicit authorization. Never force-push.
